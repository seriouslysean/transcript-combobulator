00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
That's a 16 on my save.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.600
I barely feel the cold. Used to it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.900
I grip my axe and move up front.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.800
If anything jumps out, I'm ready.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I glare at the wolves. Not backing down.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Raging. Let's go.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
I swing at the closest wolf. That's a 19 to hit.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Do I get advantage? They're flanking, right?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
I move to cover the druid. No one gets past me.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.800
If the ice cracks, I'm grabbing whoever's closest.
