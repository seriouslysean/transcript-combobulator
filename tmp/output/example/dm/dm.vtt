00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
The wind howls through the ruined village. You can barely see through the snow.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.200
Blue lights flicker in the distance. The cold is biting, even for Icewind Dale.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.400
You hear something crunching on the ice behind you.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.600
Roll a Constitution save, everyone.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.900
A figure in a tattered cloak steps out from behind a broken wall.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.800
You see a staff, glowing faintly blue at the tip.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.800
The ground cracks under your feet. Ice is spreading fast.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Winter wolves circle the party, growling low.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
The figure raises the staff. The temperature drops even more.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Roll initiative.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
You hear a distant howl, much deeper than the wolves nearby.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.800
The ice under your boots starts to crack. What do you do?
