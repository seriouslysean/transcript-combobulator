Con save is 14. Not bad.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.600
I cast Detect Magic, just in case.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.900
There's a weird aura around that staff. Necromancy?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.800
I wildshape into a bear. Roar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.800
I'm going to try to block the wolves from getting to the others.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
If the ice breaks, I can try Entangle to slow things down.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Healing myself with Cure Wounds, still in bear form.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Nature feels... off here. Like something's wrong.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.200
Ready to react if anything else shows up.
