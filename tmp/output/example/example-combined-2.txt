FILE 2 of 2

TRANSCRIPT:
Barbarian: I glare at the wolves. Not backing down.
Rogue: Shortsword out. Aiming for the big one.
DM: Winter wolves circle the party, growling low.
Druid: If the ice breaks, I can try Entangle to slow things down.
Barbarian: Raging. Let's go.
Rogue: That's a hit. Rolling damage.
DM: The figure raises the staff. The temperature drops even more.
Druid: Healing myself with Cure Wounds, still in bear form.
Barbarian: I swing at the closest wolf. That's a 19 to hit.
Rogue: If I see any traps, I'll try to disarm them.
DM: Roll initiative.
Druid: Nature feels... off here. Like something's wrong.
Barbarian: Do I get advantage? They're flanking, right?
Rogue: Staying in the shadows, moving around the edge.
DM: You hear a distant howl, much deeper than the wolves nearby.
Druid: Ready to react if anything else shows up.
Barbarian: I move to cover the druid. No one gets past me.
Rogue: If something comes at me, Uncanny Dodge.
DM: The ice under your boots starts to crack. What do you do?
Barbarian: If the ice cracks, I'm grabbing whoever's closest.
