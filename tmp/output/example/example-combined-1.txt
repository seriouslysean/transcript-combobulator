TRANSCRIPT:
DM: The wind howls through the ruined village. You can barely see through the snow.

DM: You hear something crunching on the ice behind you.
Druid: Con save is 14. Not bad.
Rogue: Con is 11. Oof.
Barbarian: That's a 16 on my save.
DM: Roll a Constitution save, everyone.
Druid: I cast Detect Magic, just in case.
Rogue: I'm going to try to sneak behind the wolves.
Barbarian: I barely feel the cold. Used to it.
Druid: There's a weird aura around that staff. Necromancy?
Rogue: Cunning Action to hide. Stealth check is 18.
Barbarian: I grip my axe and move up front.
DM: A figure in a tattered cloak steps out from behind a broken wall.
Druid: I wildshape into a bear. Roar.
Rogue: If they're distracted, I'll go for a sneak attack.
Barbarian: If anything jumps out, I'm ready.
DM: You see a staff, glowing faintly blue at the tip.
Druid: I'm going to try to block the wolves from getting to the others.
