00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
That's a 16 for Constitution.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.200
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.600
I shake off the cold easily.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.500
I ready my greataxe and step forward.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.000
[AUDIO OUT]

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.100
"We're not afraid of you, ice witch!"

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.200
I rage and charge at the robed figure with my axe raised.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.300
That's a natural 20 on my attack roll! Critical hit with the greataxe!

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
I roar with fury as I bring the axe down on the ice creature.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200
My rage gives me resistance to the cold damage from these wolves.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.500
I use my bonus action to make another attack with my off-hand weapon.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.400
The cold doesn't bother me - I'm a child of the mountains!

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.700
I position myself to protect the weaker party members from the wolves.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.000
"You picked the wrong barbarian to mess with today!"

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.800
I activate my berserker rage and enter a frenzied state of combat.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.600
Nothing will stop me from protecting my friends from this frozen evil!
