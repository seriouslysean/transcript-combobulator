00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.000
Constitution is 11. Oof.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.400
[AUDIO OUT]

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.900
I'm going to try to stealth around to get behind this figure.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.800
I use my Cunning Action to hide behind some ice formations.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.500
While they're distracted by the others, I'll try to get a sneak attack.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.400
I strike with my shortsword aimed at vital organs.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.800
That's a sneak attack! Rolling for damage with my poison-coated blade.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.600
I dart between the shadows, using the ice formations for cover.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.800
My thieves' tools might be useful for disarming any traps in these ruins.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.100
I search for weak points in the enemy's defenses while staying hidden.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.900
Using my expertise in Stealth, I move silently across the frozen ground.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.200
I prepare my hand crossbow for a ranged attack from the shadows.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.500
"You won't see me coming until it's too late, ice fiend!"

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.300
I use my Uncanny Dodge to reduce damage from the winter wolf's bite.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.100
Time to show these frozen monsters what a real assassin can do.
