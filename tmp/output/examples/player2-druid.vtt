00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.200
Constitution save is 14.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.900
I cast Detect Magic to see if there are any magical auras around us.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.200
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.400
The figure radiates strong necromancy magic.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.100
"Wait, Frodrick! This might be more dangerous than we thought."

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.800
I wildshape into a brown bear and roar in challenge.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.300
As a bear, I have resistance to cold damage and advantage on Strength checks.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
I swipe at the nearest winter wolf with my powerful claws.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.200
The natural magic in me recognizes these creatures as unnatural aberrations.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.500
I use my action to cast Cure Wounds on myself while in bear form.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.400
The connection to nature helps me resist the supernatural cold effects.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.700
I prepare to cast Entangle to slow down the approaching winter wolves.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.000
"The forest spirits are angry about this corruption of nature!"

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.800
I call upon the power of the earth to aid us in this frozen battle.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.600
My druidic senses tell me there's something deeply wrong with this place.
