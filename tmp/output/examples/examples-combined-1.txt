TRANSCRIPT:
DM: The icy winds of Icewind Dale howl through the abandoned settlement of Dougan's Hole.
DM: You see strange blue lights dancing in the distance, and the temperature drops even further.
DM: Roll a Constitution saving throw to resist the supernatural cold.
Clemeth: Constitution is 11. Oof.
Frodrick: That's a 16 for Constitution.
William: Constitution save is 14.
Frodrick: I shake off the cold easily.
Clemeth: I'm going to try to stealth around to get behind this figure.
DM: The mysterious figure in the black robes turns to face your party.
William: I cast Detect Magic to see if there are any magical auras around us.
Frodrick: I ready my greataxe and step forward.
Clemeth: I use my Cunning Action to hide behind some ice formations.
DM: "You should not have come here," the figure says in a voice like cracking ice.
William: The figure radiates strong necromancy magic.
Frodrick: "We're not afraid of you, ice witch!"
William: "Wait, Frodrick! This might be more dangerous than we thought."
Clemeth: While they're distracted by the others, I'll try to get a sneak attack.
DM: The ground beneath your feet begins to freeze, and ice crystals form in the air around you.
Frodrick: I rage and charge at the robed figure with my axe raised.
William: I wildshape into a brown bear and roar in challenge.
DM: As you approach the ancient ruins, you notice strange symbols carved into the ice.
Clemeth: I strike with my shortsword aimed at vital organs.
Frodrick: That's a natural 20 on my attack roll! Critical hit with the greataxe!
William: As a bear, I have resistance to cold damage and advantage on Strength checks.
Clemeth: That's a sneak attack! Rolling for damage with my poison-coated blade.
DM: Sudenly, a pack of winter wolves emerges from behind the frozen structures.
Frodrick: I roar with fury as I bring the axe down on the ice creature.
William: I swipe at the nearest winter wolf with my powerful claws.
